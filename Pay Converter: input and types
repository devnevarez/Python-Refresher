# Along with user input we also have to keep track of character types
# Lets create a script that determines pay per hour

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter rate:")

# After creating variables we can call, we can now create a formula within its own variable
# Keeping in mind character types must align to avoid syntax errors

pay = float(hrs) * float(rate)

# We can now call the formula and display the user input

print("Pay: " + str(pay))
